I live in Minneapolis, MN, USA with my family and like to spend my time riding bikes as much as I can.

I've worked remotely since 2014 and I love it.

I spend a lot of time thinking about clear code, software development practices, and remote work.

I work at [Arux Software](https://arux.software) as Director of Engineering.
